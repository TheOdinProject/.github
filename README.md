This is a special repo for hosting community health files and our organization profile. It has two main uses:

### Organization Landing Page

The [`README` in the profile directory](profile/README.md) will render on our [organization home page](https://github.com/TheOdinProject). 

### Default Community Health Files

Community health files are files such as `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and issue templates. Files defined in this repo will provide a fallback / default for any organization repo that doesn't have one of its own.
